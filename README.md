# DeepSynth Expo App

This project is an Expo application built with TypeScript and `expo-router`.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo`)
- An Expo account to sign in on your device

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Copy the environment example and fill in your API values:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env to include your Files.com API key and upload URL
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the Expo Go app on your physical device and scan the QR code from the terminal or browser window.

This will load the application in Expo Go for testing.
